# Verification of Offline Signature as Genuine or Forged

## Model Used
A pretrained VGG16 model, trained on Imagenet, is used and transfer learning is performed. The Model was trained on Google Colab.

## Dataset
The Data used is a combination of SigwiComp 2009 and 2011, released by International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).
The Data for this problem is uploaded on Google Drive at ___. The python scripts for arranging the raw dataset into the desired form are also included.

## How to run
Simple run the ipynb fie __. 
Note: __.py and __.py are only required when using raw Sigwicomp data. They are not required when using the data stored on drive.

## Result
After implementing transfer learning with VGG16 and fine tuning the last conv block, the following results were obtaibed:
Validation Accuracy:
Test Accuracy:
